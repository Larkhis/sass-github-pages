# This is an example site for Sass integration in Jekyll

## Overview

You have two kinds of Sass files:

1. Main files, which you wish to be output as CSS files
2. Partials, which are used by main files in `@import` statements

Main files are like pages â€“ they go where you want them to be output, and they contain the YAML front matter (`---` lines) at the top.  
Partials are like hidden Jekyll data, so they go in an underscored directory, which defaults to `_sass`. You site might look like this:

    .
    | - _sass
      | - _main.scss
    | - assets/css
      | - styles.scss

And so on.

The output, in your `_site` directory, would look like this:

    .
    | - assets/css
      | - styles.css

That's it! Now you have just your SCSS/Sass converted over to CSS with all the proper inputs.
